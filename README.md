# Path-finding

<h2>Description</h2>
A simple windowed application used to display simple visuals of basic searching algorithms. The program is designed to showcase the effects of different algorithms on different, entirely configurable, terrains.

<h2>Usage instructions</h2>
Left click to remove, place down water or blocks. Right click to set destination and middle click for starting point. TD: changes the time delay for the algorithm (the delay in milliseconds between each iteration). TS: changes the size of the tiles.

<h2>Included searching algorithms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Depth-first</h3></li>
  Simple, brute force search. Ignores terrain types.
  <li><h3>Dikjstra's</h3></li>
  Dijkstra search algorithm on grid.
  <li><h3>A*</h3></li>
  Heuristic approach to path finding.
</ul>

<h2>Extra</h2>
Algorithm also includes a maze generation algorithm.
